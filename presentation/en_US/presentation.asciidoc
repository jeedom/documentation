Around this core, plugins of any kind can integrate:

- home automation protocol (Z-Wave, RFXcom, EnOcean...),
- other protocol IP (KNX, xPL...),
- communicating objects (Nest, Netatmo, ...),
- High level plugin (alarm, thermostat ...)
- interface (widget),
- organization (agenda, Google agenda),
- development (script).
